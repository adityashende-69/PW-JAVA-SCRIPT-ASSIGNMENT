/*
set of instructions to be repeatedly executed until a certain condition is met.  
they are essentintial for automating repetitive tasks, iterating over data structures, 
and marking code more efficient.

there are total three main types on loops 

1 for loop
2 while loop 
3 do while loop  


example  -  1. FOR loop
for
    initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
{
    logic we have to implement
}

        2. While loop
while (condition)
{
    logic
}
      
        3. Do-While loop:
do
{
    /logic
}        while (condition);
