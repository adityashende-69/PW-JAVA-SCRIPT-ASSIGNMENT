// 1. Unary operators:
// unary opeartors work with single operand 
// ex:
let x = 5;
x++;

// 2. Binary operators:
// Binary operators work with two operand
let a = 5;
let b = 3;
let sum = a + b;

// 3. Ternary opearator: 
//the ternary opearator is unique in that it works with three operands.
// ex:
let age = 20;
let canlegalage = age >= 21 ? "YES"  :   "NO" ;
