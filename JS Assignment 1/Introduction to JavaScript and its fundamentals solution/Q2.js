// html vs js 
 /* HTML= Use HTML to create the basic structure and content of a webpage. It's perfect for defining the layout, 
    text, images, links,and general content.

    JavaScript=  Use JavaScript when you need to add interactivity, perform validations, handle events, dynamically
    update content, or create a more engaging user experience. It's essential for making websites responsive and interactive,
    enabling user input and real-time changes without needing to reload the entire page.

    /* 1. Programming Language: JavaScript is a full-fledged programming language used to add interactivity, manipulate content, and 
    create dynamic experiences in web development. It works on the client-side, allowing for real-time changes and responses without
     reloading the page.

    2. Dynamic Interactivity: JavaScript enables dynamic changes on a webpage, such as updating content, handling user interactions 
    (like clicks, forms, etc.), and creating animations.

    the layout and elements on a page, such as text, images, links, headings, paragraphs, etc.
