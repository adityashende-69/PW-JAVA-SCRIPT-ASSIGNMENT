/* 1. Readability: Clear and descriptive names make the code more readable and understandable. They provide context and intentions,
making it easier for other developers (or your future self) to comprehend the purpose of the variable.

2. Maintainability: When variables have meaningful names, it's easier to maintain the code. If changes or updates are necessary, a 
well-named variable can indicate its usage, reducing the chance of errors while modifying the code.

 3. Documentation: Descriptive variable names can act as a form of self-documentation, reducing the need for excessive comments by
explaining the purpose of the variable directly in its name.

//  example with Descriptive naming
let firstNUmber = 13;
let secondNumber = 40;
let sum = firstNUmber + secondNumber;
