 /*Declaring variables in JavaScript serves the purpose of reserving memory space to store data. 
 This allows you to store and manipulate values, making your code dynamic and adaptable.
 */
 // example:  
let variableName;
let age;
 // let age = 21;

// these are the some purpose of declaring variables:
/*1. Memory Allocation: Declaring variables reserves memory space for the data you intend to store. 
This allows you to reference and manipulate the data throughout your program.

2. Dynamic Data Handling: Variables enable your code to be more adaptable by storing different values.
 They can be updated, changed, and used in various operations within your program.

3. Scope Control: Variables declared using let have block scope. This means they are only accessible within
the block (like a function or a statement) they are declared in, which helps in maintaining code organization 
and reducing unexpected behavior.
